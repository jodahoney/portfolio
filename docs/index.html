<p class="lead">
Hello, I am Joseph Dehoney, but I mostly go by Joe (or Joda depending on when we met).
</p>
<p class="lead">
I'm a Stanford M.S. CS student working at the intersection of <strong>quantum information</strong>,
<strong>quantum complexity</strong>, and <strong>learning problems in physics</strong>.
<br>
My research aims to understand which tasks in quantum information and complexity can be solved efficiently, which are provably hard, and how structural features mediate the gap between them. 
Many of the problems I am drawn to take the form of learning properties of a system and then matching information-theoretic limits with concrete algorithms. 
In the long run, I hope this perspective will help identify which problems are truly amenable to efficient quantum or classical methods and inform the design of reliable computational tools for science and engineering.

  <h2>Research interests</h2>
  My research has gone in a couple different directions in the past few years. Previously, my work was in medical machine learning.
  Now, in conjunction with maintaining my past ML projects, my research revolves around trying to better understand the advantages and limitations of quantum computing. The following are a few central themes
  that my recent research has pursued:
  <ul class="bullets">
    <li><strong>Verification & structure:</strong> when does mathematical structure or physical constraints allow for a quantum speedup?</li>
    <li><strong>Learning in many-body settings:</strong> identifiability and complexity of learning local Hamiltonians / Gibbs states from local data.</li>
    <li><strong>Noise & robustness:</strong> stabilizing estimation and optimization under realistic noise models.</li>
  </ul>

      <h3>Quantum optimization of MIS with Rydberg atom arrays (course presentation)</h3>
      <p>
        Synthesized a paper on solving Max Independent Set with programmable Rydberg-atom arrays, focusing on the MIS to blockade mapping and how control schedules (detuning/Rabi) realize analog optimization. Presented the work as a course final project in quantum control and engineering.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
  Alongside quantum research, I build data pipelines at Stanford for multimodal biomedical and neuroimaging research datasets
  (automation, CI validation, Slurm/Docker/AWS workflows). I enjoy the full lifecycle: from idea → implementation → results → writeup.
